Over the past few weeks, our research team has worked through a series of
ecological data workflows—exploring PCA ordination, NDVI symbology, spatial
clipping, and ordinal regression modeling. These weren’t just technical
exercises. Each step was shaped by a deeper question: **how can data guide
better decisions for species, ecosystems, and landscapes under threat?**

## 🔍 Grounded in Ecological Meaning

Analysis in conservation must be biologically literate. When modeling elephant
habitat, for example, we asked:

- How far is too far from water?
- What elevation zones correlate with dung presence?
- Which topographic features matter most?

We didn't treat PCA loadings or regression outputs as abstract patterns. Every
plot and table was scrutinized for its ecological plausibility.

## 📊 Multivariate Analysis with Clarity

We used PCA to reduce dimensionality in habitat variables and visualize
ecological gradients. Each site was labeled and grouped by dung presence.

```r
fviz_pca_biplot(pca_result,
                geom.ind = "point",
                col.ind = df$feces,
                addEllipses = TRUE,
                label = "var") +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = df$location), size = 3.5)
```

To increase interpretability, we annotated each plot with relevant axes labels
(e.g., "Jarak Ke Air"), adjusted margins, and grouped by meaningful site categories.

## 🌿 Raster Processing & NDVI in QGIS

Satellite data preprocessing included band stacking, NDVI computation, and
masking with AOI boundaries. While Python scripts could automate this, QGIS
offered greater transparency during exploration.

Typical workflow:

- Stack `B04` and `B08` from Sentinel or Landsat.
- Calculate NDVI using Raster Calculator:

```
(B08 - B04) / (B08 + B04)
```

- Apply AOI mask with `Raster > Extraction > Clip Raster by Mask Layer`.
- Style using custom NDVI symbology (.qml) for reproducibility.

## 📈 Ordinal Regression for Ranked Habitat Suitability

We modeled multi-class outcomes (e.g. low–medium–high suitability) using ordinal
logistic regression. Category thresholds were annotated to interpret transitions.

```r
library(MASS)
model <- polr(suitability ~ distance_water + elevation + cover, data = df, 
  Hess = TRUE)
summary(model)
```

To explore how prediction categories change across a variable:

```r
library(effects)
plot(Effect("distance_water", model), main = "Effect of Water Distance")
```

And for a quick confusion matrix comparing predicted vs actual:

```r
table(Predicted = predict(model), Actual = df$suitability)
```

These results were visualized with faceted bar plots and transition point
annotations to communicate uncertainty and overlap between classes.

## 🧬 From Workflow to Reusable System

Our approach isn’t just about one paper or project. We’re assembling a **modular
pipeline** for ecological modeling—components that can be reused across studies:

- Reproducible PCA biplots with `ggplot2` and `factoextra`.
- Ordinal regression diagnostics and visualizations.
- NDVI pipelines in both R and QGIS.
- Spatial masking, stacking, and standard styling for rapid visual output.

These tools aren't abstract—they're tuned for field-ready, stakeholder-relevant
conservation decisions.

---

## 🌱 What’s Next?

We're continuing to translate ecological questions into actionable insights.
Upcoming Notivra posts will explore:

- Annotating category transition points in ordinal models.
- Automating spatial processing with R (`sf`, `terra`, `stars`).
- Building multilingual dashboards for communicating results to communities and
policymakers.
